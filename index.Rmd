description: "A primary goal of predictive modeling is to find a reliable and effective predic- tive relationship between an available set of features and an outcome. This book provides an extensive set of techniques for uncovering effective representations of the features for modeling the outcome and for finding an optimal subset of features to improve a model’s predictive performance."

# Preface {-}

The goal of our previous work, _Applied Predictive Modeling_, was to elucidate a framework for constructing models that generate accurate predictions for future, yet-to-be-seen data.  This framework includes pre-processing the data, splitting the data into training and testing sets, selecting an approach for identifying optimal tuning parameters, building models, and estimating predictive performance.
